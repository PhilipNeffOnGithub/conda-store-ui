# Introduction

Welcome to the conda-store-ui project documentation! conda-store-ui is a frontend for conda-store, allowing interaction with environments through its interface. As a pre-requiste, you will need to have access to a running instance of conda-store.

However, if you'd like to play with the frontend locally, we do provide a docker installation that will be sufficient.

If you'd like to check conda-store out first, visit [conda.store](https://conda.store/en/latest).
